                    <p>London, November 16.</p>
                    <p>All accounts from Russia show that the conclusive struggle between the
                        autocracy ant the revolutionary party has begun.</p>
                    <p>( Reuter)</p>
                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 16.</p>

                    <p>59.000 men are now on strike. It is feared that a hooligan outbreak may take
                        place at any moment. The situation is so grave that the British Embassy is
                        arranging to send away British single women and governesses. Those choosing
                        to remain, will do so at their own risk.</p>

                    <p>The union of professional men have decided to strike in order to further
                        political aims.</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 16.</p>

                    <p>59.000 men are at present on strike, but here is some reason to question its
                        duration owing to lack of funds and the extreme distress it causes among the
                        working classes.</p>

                    <p>The employes of the St Petersburg-Moscow railway have struck.</p>

                    <p>M. Witte has issued an appeal to the factory hands in which he says :
                        “Brothers return to your work. Pity your wives and children, and pay no heed
                        to evil counsellors Listen to the man who loves: you and who will do his
                        utmost to give effect to the Emperor's solicitude in your behalf; only give
                        os time.”</p>
                    <p>Indignation and alarm are felt in South Russia on account of the fact that
                        two Imperial ukases commend the Governor of Bessarabia, whom the Jews hold
                        responsible for the massacres at Kishineff and elsewhere, and thank the
                        troops at Odessa for their exemplary conduct during the disorders.</p>

                        and he states that it is hoped that the Ministry of the Interior will
                        rescind the old and order a new election.</p>

                        where an address from the borough of Paddington was presented to his
                        Majesty. On the way to the City his Majesty also received addresses from the
                        Corporation of Westminster, the Borough of Marylebone, and the Borough of
                        Holborn at Oxford-circus. A procession of carriages was formed, and the King
                        of the Hellenes drove to the Guildhall, where he was received by the Lord
                        Mayor and Corporation of the City, who presented him with an address,
                        previous to entertaining him to luncheon. The address was enclosed in
                        magnificent gold casket, which was surmount by a figure of Britannia seated
                        in a classic Greek galley. His Majesty was in the uniform of a British
                        Admiral and wore the insignia of the Garier. Princess Nicholas was dressed

                        the progress of his country had been enlarged beyond all expectations.
                        Greece, like Great Britain, looks to peace as the beat guarantee of a
                        nation's progress.</p>

                    <p>His Majesty was attended to and from the Guildhall by a Sovereign’s escort of
                        Royal Horse Guards with Standard, and a Guard of Honor of the Honorable
                        Artillery Company was mounted at the Guildhall. The route to and from
