                <div type="item"><head>RENTS IN CAIRO.</head>
                <p>Some time ago our columns contained a correspondence in which the question whether a young Englishman could live in Cairo at L10 a month was argued with eloquence and vigour. We should now like to bring before the notice of our readers the results of the raising of rents in Cairo as far as they touch young British officials, and others of the same class, and whose standard of life is the same. The average young Englishman of this type, when he first comes to Egypt,goes to a pension for some little time and then, if he can afford it, takes a flat with one or more friends. Well and good if his pay allows of it, but there are plenty of young Englishmen whose pay is not high and who cannot afford a comfortable and healthy flat. A man drawing anything under L30 a month had better stay in a pension, for, if he takes a cheap flat in the less-known quarters of Cairo, he runs a risk of catching typhoid or of finding himself in an uncongenial neighborhoood.  </p>
                <p>As for the pensions,there are two or three good and thoroughly well-managed English pensions, if not more; but in all the prices are rather high and will never get any lower. The increased price of food, the rise in rents,which forces those who manage pensions to heighten their charges, and the growing demands of the native servant,all tell on the pocket of the young man with a fixed income. Now if he wishes to go to a good pension of the second order- we do not wish to name names or advertise any of these establishments- he may fall on his feet. But he may also find that in his pension are persons whom he does not care to know, and whose very presence under the same roof may injure him. A young employe of any business or commercial establishment has to be careful, not for social reasons, for, snobbish though we are as a nation,the average Englishman does not suppose that his subordinates are to be judged and condemned because they happen to sleep under the same roof and to dine in the same room as undesirable characters, but because Egypt posseses more than a fair share of unscrupulous and needy persons of many nationalities- our own not excepted- who are on the watch for the young man from home. The slightest indiscretion, even a refusal to discuss a subject, may give the wily enquirer a valuable "tip," and therefore the bank manager and his fellows like to see their subordinates staying in establishments where the man with an axe to grind is rare.</p>
                <p>But these establishments, as we have pointed out, grow dearer and take more of a man's pay. To the young permanent official this does not matter quite so much, for he comes out to make a career and to retire with a pension, and ought to be able to wait and at least simulate contentment, though if promotion is slow or his Under-Secreatary of State or departmental chief forgets to recommend that his pay be raised before the new financial year begins- and once upon a time a chief forgot to recommend a single man in his department and his staff fumed for months, having been promised mountains and marvels- this simulation is hard to keep up. But the young employe of a bank or business house, who has to keep up appearances like the rest, to pay calls, dress,return bachelor hospitality, and join clubs, remarks with grief that while rents and prices rise wages do not rise at all. The economic books say they do; it may be true in Europe, and it may be true of certain classes here, but it is not true of the class of which we speak. Can any of our readers give a recipe for the "simple life" (with appearances saved and thrown in) and a credit balance monthly, or is it impossible to eat your cake and have it too?</p></div>

<p>There is no truth in the statement of a contemporary that a misunderstanding has occurred between the Cairo Tramway Company and the Ministry of Public Works oh the subject of the new carriages, with first-class compartments, which it is intended to place very shortly on all the lines. There has been some delay in their delivery, but it is expected that they will be running by the new year, These carriages, which have a compartment for first-class passengers in front, another for ladies at the end, and accommodation for the second class in the centre, should prove a great boon to those residents who are compelled to use the tramcars several times daily between their homes and offices, and we congratulate M. Dessalles, the energetic manager, on this innovation.

The company will in a short time begin the laying of the now extension from the present terminus at Boulac to the Boole des Arts et Metiers. Some delay has occurred in beginning the work on account of the difficulties the company has encountered from the owners of the properties to be expropriated for this purpose.</p></div>

<p>This well-known hostelry has been sold by Mr. Klingler, the proprietor and manager of the Continental Hotel in Cairo, to Mr. Henri Chamoulleau, former proprietor of the Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria, who will enter into possession on the 15th November. During the four years that the hotel has been in possession of the former gentleman he has succeeded in forming a high-class clientele, which no doubt Mr. Chamoulleau will not only retain but increase, since his reputation as an hotelier has long been established.

Daring the summer a large sum of money has been spent on alterations and improvements at the Savoy Hotel, which will add greatly to the comfort of visitors. The whole of the shops facing the quay have been removed and replaced by a fine dining saloon and bar opening on the sea front and supported by massive marble columns. The additions include 32 newly-built bedrooms, which bring up the total to 74. Mr. Klingler lately obtained an extension of the lease from the Messageries Maritimes, who are the owners of the whole large block of buildings in which the hotel is situated.</p></div>

<p>Details of the fighting which occurred at Hodeida, in the Yemen, when the British cruiser Fox was at that place a few weeks ago in connection with the pursuit and punishment of the pirates who bad attacked British dhows, have just been received. Claims were lodged with the Porte in regard to these outrages, and the Pox was despatched to the Yemen coast in order to see that the local authorities carried out the British demands, arrested and punished the guilty persons, and destroyed the pirate dhows.	

The British cruiser co-operated with the local Turkish authorities in the accomplishment of these objects. It was found that the pirates bad moored their dhows at a place called Khor Gbu’eifaka, which was not easy for the Turks to attack and that the former had mounted guns round the cove where the pirate chips were lying. A stiff fight occurred, in which the pirates lost twenty-five killed and a large number of wounded. A launch belonging to the Fox went aground and was lost, and one British sailor was slightly wounded.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY

REPLY TO “ALEXANDRIAN. ’’

To THE Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</head> <p>Sir,—In your paper of yesterday you publish a letter under the above heading signed "Alexandrian,” containing certain malicious statements, which, if true, would not only reflect very seriously on me and my colleagues, past and present, on the board of the Alexandria Water Company, Ltd., but also on the character of many high officials of the Egyptian Government, who, during a long series of years, have represented the Government on the board of that company.

Your correspondent says  "it was discovered " that the company were charging the double of what they were legally entitled to for a " girbeh of water.” This statement is absolutely false ; the Water Company never has sold water at any higher price than they were legally entitled to. 

In the autumn of 1878 the waterworks of Alexandria were offered for sale in London, by a man of the highest integrity, then Minister of Finance to the Egyptian Government, under certain conditions, and one of the most attractive of these conditions was, that a certain branch of the service known as the Sakkas, or water carriers, service, brought in a net revenue of £12,000 a year ; this was not an estimated revenue, but one which had been realised for many years by the Egyptian Government itself, at the price at which it had sold the water, and proposed to transfer and did subsequently transfer, to its purchaser, the Water Company, by contract of sale, the right to continue the sale of water on the same condition, and at the same tariff as that in use by the Government during the many years it had worked the undertaking. Not only is this confirmed by contract, but the gentleman to whom I above refer, is still living, and not only can, but would contradict me, if anything I say in this matter is not strictly true, The Water Company rotated this right until 1894, when it gave it up not as your correspondent says, because it was an extortion, but as the result of an agreement with the Municipality of Alexandria, who offered in exchange for it a new system of filtration subject only to a contribution of L.E. 10,000 by the Water Company, and not only this, but they gave the company the right to sell water by meter, a right which led to complications, reference to which would tale up too much of your space.

Not only was it the first duty of the Government representatives on our board to assure themselves that the Water Company was acting in accordance with its legal rights, bat I am in a position to say, without fear of contradiction, that one and all of these gentlemen conscientiously did their duty in this respect	

There are several other inaccuracies in the letter under notice, which I could easily refute, but will not weary your readers by doing so at present.	

I write only in my own name, and without prejudice to any action in the matter which my colleagues may decide to take ; they are men as well known as any in Alexandria, and it requires no testimony of mine to defend them ; but in memory of those with whom I formerly had the honor of being associated, and who have gone from this world and are no longer able to defend themselves, I will, say, that it is a disgraceful action to endeavor to sully their names by such false insinuations; for they were honorable men, who,under trying circumstances, did the best which could be expected of them for the general good.

I do not know who your correspondent "Alexandrian” may be, nor have I the slightest wish to make his acquaintance, for, in my opinion, a man who would publish the malicious statements he has made, on a subject oh which be shows that he is profoundly ignorant, is beneath contempt.—I remain, etc., E. Cornish,

A director of the Alexandria Water;

Company, Limited. Alexandria, 12th November.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>A FRENCHMAN IN THESUDAN.

HIS IMPRESSIONS.</head>

<p>M. E. Sulesses, director of the railway in French Guinea, has just returned to Paris from an official visit to Africa, during which be inspected all the railways now working on this continent, and saw a good deal of the Sudan and Egypt

It is satisfactory to note for the future good relations of France and England in Africa that M. Salesses is an Anglophila He was presented to all the British officials in the course of his itinerary, and received the greatest assistance from their hands. His speaks particularly well of Sir Reginald Wingate— as, indeed, do all his compatriots. The Sirdar has known how to make himself extremely liked by the French because of his tact and consideration. M. Salesses exchanged a few words with Lord Cromer, and was impressed with the power of the man, even in so short an interview.	

As to the treatment of the natives by the British Administration, M. Salessies regards it somewhat in the light of mistaken kindness. The native is a child, and must be treated as such. Occasionally it is necessary to show firmness. You cannot apply all the ideas of Western justice to him. The judicial branch must not bo separated from the political and executive. There is no division of, labour amongst the native Africans. The potter digs his own clay ; the bootmaker is a tanner. And so the Commissioner in charge of a district should himself bo able to apply the law. Justice must be swift The native does not understand being punished three months after the commission of a crime. Three months is too long for his memory— he has forgotten all about the offence.”

M. Salesses shares the view of Lord Cromer that the Cape-to-Cairo railway can very properly utilise a steamboat service on the lakes and the White Nile to connect its sections. He thinks that Germany should strike a bargain with England over the lease of a atrip of land between Tanganyika and Victoria Nyanza. Such a cession of territory would work no prejudice to German interests; on the contrary, the communication afforded by the railway would be highly profitable to the colony.</p></div>
